What is the first step someone should take on the path to purchasing a home?

**Before doing anything else, buyers should set their sights on their finances**. Knowing what financial options are available is essential. Therefore, finding the right lender will also be key.

Our team has a number of preferred lending partners who we would be happy to recommend to you when we sit down to begin strategizing your home search. Also during that meeting, we will nail down the specific criteria you’re looking for in a home.

**Once we’ve got a plan for financing and we understand what kind of home you want, the next step is to start shopping.**

All of this and more is covered during the free strategy sessions our team offers. Whether you’re looking to buy in the next couple of months or in the next couple of years, we would be happy to speak to you about your goals.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
