If you’re thinking about waiting to buy a home, you may want to think again. Now is a much better time to buy than it will likely be in the future, and there a couple of reasons why:

1. **Interest rates are at a historic low.** Rates in the 1970s were at about 8.86%, 12.7% in the 1980s, 8.12% in the 1990s, and 6.2% in the 2000s. If you want to know how low they are now, reach out to me so I can connect you with one of our great lenders.<br> 
2. **You’ll be paying your own mortgage.** If you don’t own a home, you’re simply paying down someone else’s mortgage with each monthly payment. Why not build your own equity instead?
