If you’re interested in becoming a homeowner and you expect to receive a sizeable tax refund this year, there are a couple things we can do with your tax refund that will help you purchase a home:

1. **Save for the down payment.** If you’re applying for a home loan, it’s a great idea to partner with a lender to find out how much your down payment would need to be. Your tax refund could either become a part of or the whole of your down payment, depending on your loan.<br>&nbsp;
2. **Pay for the closing costs.** &nbsp;The closing costs for a typical loan are somewhere around 2% to 5% of the purchase price of the home. Your tax refund could be a huge contribution to that amount.<br>&nbsp;
3. **Pay off some off your credit/debt.** If debt or bad credit is holding you back from buying a home (or from buying the kind of home you want), why not put your tax refund toward eliminating that debt, thus making you eligible for a home loan or for a higher purchase amount? This could involve paying off a car loan, a credit card, student loans, or bank loans, just to name a few examples. Remember that it’s recommended to pay credit card balances below 30%, so you may not need to use the entirety of your refund to do so. Talk to your credit counselor to be sure of what you’d need to accomplish to be best positioned to buy a home.
